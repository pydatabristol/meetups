## What we are about

PyData Bristol is the Bristol chapter of the international PyData community.

PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers
of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global
PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and
emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and
visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages,
including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.

PyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization
in the United States. The PyData Code of Conduct
([http://pydata.org/code-of-conduct.html][coc]) governs this meetup. To discuss
any issues or concerns relating to the code of conduct or the behavior of
anyone at a PyData meetup, please contact NumFOCUS Executive Director Leah
Silen (+1 512-222-5449; leah@numfocus.org) or the group organiser.
